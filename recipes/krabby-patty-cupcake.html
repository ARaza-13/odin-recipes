<h4>How to Make</h4>

        <p>
            For the burger buns: Prep mini ball pan and 9” round pan with shortening/flour or baking spray. Add some sesame seeds 
            to the bottoms of the mini ball pan BEFORE adding cake batter. Fill each cavity halfway with the butter pecan cake mix, 
            and add remaining mix to the 9” round cake pan/s. Bake according to box instructions for cupcakes. Baking time will 
            vary depending on oven and amount of cake batter used, check cake early and regularly to prevent burning. Let cake 
            sit in pans for 10 minutes before transferring to cooling rack. Once the cake is cooled completely, cut off the bottoms 
            of the half-sphere cakes to create the bun tops, and use a 3” round circle cutter on the 9” round cake to cut out 
            circles for the bottom half of the burger buns.

            For the meat patty: Bake chocolate fudge cake according to box instructions in either a 9” round pan or a 13 by 9” 
            baking pan. Keep in mind that the smaller the pan, the thicker the “patties” will be. Once baked and cooled, use 
            the 3” circle cutter to cut out chocolate circles of cake to be the patties. Attach patty to the bottom half of 
            the burger bun using white frosting in a mayonnaise-like fashion.

            For the cheese: Dye or use pre-made yellow fondant, and roll to a uniform 1/8” thickness on a mat dusted in cornstarch 
            to prevent sticking. Use a square cutter to cut out slices of cheese. Drape the fondant slice over the patty so that 
            the corners hang down realistically.

            For the onions: Roll out white fondant to a uniform ¼” thickness on a mat dusted in cornstarch to prevent sticking. 
            Use a 3” circle cutter to cut out the circles of onion. Use progressively smaller circle cutters to imprint concentric 
            circles in the fondant circle, creating a realistic onion look. Use a small amount of purple pearl dust and imitation 
            (clear) vanilla extract mixed together as paint for the edges of the onion slices. Attach onion fondant to the cheese 
            slice using a dab of white frosting. Position so that the onion visible hangs out.

            For the tomatoes: Dye or use pre-made red fondant, and roll to a uniform ¼” thickness on a mat dusted in cornstarch to 
            prevent sticking. Use the 3” circle cutter to cut out tomato slice. If desired, paint edges of tomato in clear edible 
            gel to add gloss. Attach to onion slice using a dab of white frosting. Position so that the tomato hangs over the edge 
            on the opposite side of the onion slice.
        </p>

            For the pickles: dye or use pre-made green fondant, and roll to a uniform ¼” thickness on a mat dusted in cornstarch 
            to prevent sticking. Use the 1” scalloped circle cutter to cut out at least 3 pickle slices per burger. Using the 
            paint brush, a pen, or a similarly round tool, impress ridges into the surface of the pickle slices to create a 
            realistic cut pickle look. Attach multiple pickle slices to the tomato slice using a dab of frosting.
        </p>

            For the lettuce: Cut off the tip of a pastry bag and fit it with a large petal frosting tip. Fill the pastry bag with 
            green frosting. Practice creating a frosting ruffle on a scrap piece of paper or the countertop. Ruffle frosting 
            around the top of the burger stack, creating a border about 1/3 in to the center of the burger. When finished, place 
            the burger bun top onto the icing. There should be no visible gaps in the ruffled frosting, so that it looks like one 
            big piece of lettuce.
